-- +-------------+---------+
-- | product_id  | int     |
-- | low_fats    | enum    |
-- | recyclable  | enum    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
-- recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
--  

-- Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

--  

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Products table:
-- +-------------+----------+------------+
-- | product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
-- +-------------+----------+------------+
-- | 0           | Y        | N          |
-- | 1           | Y        | Y          |

-- | 4           | N        | N          |
-- +-------------+----------+------------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | product_id  |
-- +-------------+
-- | 1           |
-- | 3           |
-- +-------------+
-- Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

Select product_id from products where low_fats='Y' and recyclable='Y';


-- Table: Customer

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | name        | varchar |
-- | referee_id  | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
--  

-- Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

--  

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Customer table:
-- +----+------+------------+
-- | id | name | referee_id |
-- +----+------+------------+
-- | 1  | Will | null       |
-- | 2  | Jane | null       |
-- | 3  | Alex | 2          |
-- | 4  | Bill | null       |
-- | 5  | Zack | 1          |
-- | 6  | Mark | 2          |
-- +----+------+------------+
-- Output: 
-- +------+
-- | name |
-- +------+
-- | Will |
-- | Jane |
-- | Bill |
-- | Zack |
-- +------+

select name from customer where referee_id != 2 or referee_id is null;




-- Table: Accounts

-- +-------------+------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
-- +-------------+------+
-- | account_id  | int  |
-- | income      | int  |
-- +-------------+------+
-- account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

-- Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

-- "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
-- "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
-- "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
-- The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Accounts table:
-- +------------+--------+
-- | account_id | income |
-- +------------+--------+
-- | 3          | 108939 |
-- | 2          | 12747  |
-- | 8          | 87709  |
-- | 6          | 91796  |
-- +------------+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +----------------+----------------+
-- | category       | accounts_count |
-- +----------------+----------------+
-- | Low Salary     | 1              |
-- | Average Salary | 0              |
-- | High Salary    | 3              |
-- +----------------+----------------+
-- Explanation: 
-- Low Salary: Account 2.
-- Average Salary: No accounts.
-- High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.

select 
"Low Salary" as category,
sum(case when income < 20000 then 1 else 0 end) as accounts_count
from accounts 

union 
select
"Average Salary" as category,
sum(case when income >= 20000 and income <=50000 then 1 else 0 end) as accounts_count
from accounts 

union
select 
"High Salary" as category,

-- Table: Employees

-- +-------------+----------+
-- | Column Name | Type     |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | employee_id | int      |
-- | name        | varchar  |
-- | manager_id  | int      |
-- | salary      | int      |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

-- Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input:  
-- Employees table:
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- | employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- | 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
-- | 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
-- | 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
-- | 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
-- | 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
-- | 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
-- +-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | employee_id |
-- +-------------+
-- | 11          |
-- +-------------+

-- Explanation: 
-- The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
-- Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
-- Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
